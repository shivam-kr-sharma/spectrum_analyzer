In this folder (named "spectrum analyzer") there are csv files which contain the data (frequency vs voltage) from the spectrum analyzer. These files are in "Data" folder.

The settings of the spectrum analyzer has been saved as "Settings.HDS". 

About the setup:

Two lasers each connected to 80/20 fiber splitters (80% of the power is used for the spectroscopic purpose and 20% is used for the beat measurement.) are used. The 20% end of each laser is further connected to a 50/50 fiber splitter.

### The power of the laser input in the 50/50 ends are
Laser 1 - 2.58 mW

Laser 2 - 4.45 mW


Frequency of the laser used = 6 MHz.

Further information about the data is found in the readme of the "Data" folder.
